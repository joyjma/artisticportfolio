            <h2>A Screenplay Loosely Based on Infinite Jest</h2>
            <p>I wrote this for a half-term class I took at MIT, Big Books: Infinite Jest. On our last day of class, we did a reading. It was fantastic to see how each person in my class brought their own unique voice, bringing the text to life with a whole new personality I could not have imagined on my own. Enjoy!</p>
            <p><strong>A screenplay of scenes from DFW's Infinite Jest</strong></p>

            <h3>Characters</h3>
            <p><strong>DEAN</strong> - Human. Loosely based on school dean from opening scene of the novel</p>
            <p><strong>ADELINT</strong> - Human. Loosely based on Aubrey deLint</p>
            <p><strong>DOG</strong> - Hal. Chronically misunderstood.</p>
            <p><strong>BUNNY1</strong> - Bunny. Misunderstands Bunny 2.</p>
            <p><strong>BUNNY2</strong> - Bunny. Misunderstood by Bunny 1 and the humans.</p>
            <p><strong>JOELLE</strong> - Joelle van Dyne</p>
            <p><strong>MOLLY</strong> - Molly Notkin</p>
            <p><strong>GUY</strong> </p>
            <p><strong>GUY2/ORIN</strong> </p>
            <p><strong>ORIN'S HITTING PARTNER</strong> </p>
            <p><strong>COACH</strong> </p>
            
            <h3>Start of script</h3>
            <p>Based on Hal's tennis office scene on page 3.<br>
            Also contains parallels to "Incarnations of burned children" short story by DFW.</p>

            <h3>Setting</h3>

            He runs and runs and runs.<br>
            We see a sign that says "Football tryouts"<br>
            Orin does great in the sprint test. He is able to memorize all of the plays flawlessly. However, when it comes to throwing the ball, his body turns limp and his hands are sweaty and the ball keeps slipping from his hands.<br>
            The coach approaches and takes the ball from him.]</p>

            <p class="character">COACH</p>
            <p class="dialogue">Good try though.</p>
            <p class="stage-direction">[Orin turns around. Walks away, and we see behind him the tryouts resume. A blank expression on Orin's face. Over his shoulder we get a glimpse of Joelle dancing and cheering. Then, her face goes wide and we see the football hurling over Orin's head and lands in front of him.<br>
            Orin doesn't even blink. He keeps walking until he's at the spot where the ball landed and in one swoop, bends down<br>
            On a tennis court, the screen flashes to him grabbing a tennis ball<br>
            He picks up the football<br>
            Orin serves the tennis ball<br>
            He lifts the football and turns towards the field<br>
            Orin has a tennis ball hurling back towards him on the service return<br>
            Orin starts running with the football<br>
            Orin is running to the tennis ball while starting his backswing<br>
            Orin drops the football and starts to swing his leg<br>
            The tennis ball approaches Orin and he swings his racket forward<br>
            The football is dropping<br>
            The tennis ball approaches<br>
            Football drops<br>
            Tennis ball approaches<br>
            Foot swinging<br>
            Racket swinging<br>
            Foot swinging<br>
            Racket contacts and produces the most spinny beautiful lob<br>
            Foot makes contact and the ball starts flying<br>
            Tennis ball flying<br>
            Football flying<br>
            Tennis ball flying<br>
            Football flying<br>

            Football flying<br>
            Tennis ball flying<br>
            Football flying<br>
            Tennis ball lands in the court then bounces 50 feet over the fence and lands in the pond<br>
            Football flies thru the U<br>
            Tennis spectators cheering<br>
            Football coach and team jaw dropped. Meanwhile, very dramatic music has been building to this moment.<br>
            Orin turns back around and walks away from the field. Over his shoulder, the football coach is chasing him screaming WAIT! WAIT!!]<br>

            <h3>Afterword p934</h3>
            <p class="stage-direction">[We see a little boy pick up a dead rat from the ground. It looks oddly familiar to the squirrel DOG brought inside the house in the first scene of this screenplay. He buries it in his backyard. Some seasons pass. The boy comes back and digs out the rat, now the flesh has decomposed and he is left with a rat skull.</p>

            <p class="stage-direction">[The boy is older now. He is scrolling on the Internet, and is on a butcher website. SHEEP HEADS FOR SALE. He buys one. He buries it with his friend, as a fun experiment. He digs it up a few months later, and now has a skull trophy.</p>

            <p class="stage-direction">[The boy is even older. It is thundering and lightning-ing outside. The boy is digging with a shovel in his backyard. He is burying a man. When he is finished burying and covering the body, we see a timelapse of the ground.<br>
            Now it is spring.<br>
            The DOG walks on top of the mound. He starts barking.<br>
            He is quoting Hamlet again ("Alas, Poor Yorick!").]</p>
