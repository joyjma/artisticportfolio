                <p style="margin-top: 2rem; font-style: italic; color: #666;">Drum.<br>
                Stop</p>

                <p style="margin-top: 2rem;">This is my family.</p>

                <p>This is me and my grandfather. My grandfather studied physics in college and came to the States from Shanghai, China when my father was 10 to do research when China and the US opened their doors to each other. He lives in Shanghai.</p>

                <p>This is my grandmother. She flew from Shanghai to Denver every summer until I was 14 to take care of my sister and I.</p>

                <p>Here is my great-uncle. He lives in Beijing and he lives in New York, with his wife and his daughter, my aunt, who was China-born, NYU-schooled and is new york city Big-four American firm-employed.</p>

                <p>Here is my father, he is a Chinese-born American. He loves the way Shanghai raised him and showed him ideas and America gave him the freedom to use his upbringing and build and think and speak for himself.</p>

                <p>Here is my mother. She is a Chinese-born American. She does not identify as Chinese without the American.</p>

                <p>This is my sister. She is American.</p>

                <p>This is Daniel. Before I was born, my parents met his Hong-Kong-raised parents and he is my family.<br>
                This is kevin and kyle and Daniel again and they are my family.</p>

                <p style="margin-top: 2rem;">This is my family and they are who I am.<br>
                They are all that I am.<br>
                People may say that I am Chinese <em>(click)</em>,<br>
                But the only part of China that is in me is the China that is in:</p>

                <p>My grandfather who is married to my<br>
                Grandmother who is sisters in law with my great uncle who is married to<br>
                My great aunt who is mother to<br>
                Lucy Ma who is cousins to<br>
                Haibing Ma who is married to<br>
                Judy Chen<br>
                Who is mother to joy and lilian ma.</p>

                <p>Despite China <em>(click)</em> who removed my family before and after they were born,<br>
                Despite the colonizers who Orientalized and otherized and mythologicalized what it means to be Chinese<br>
                I still have my blood and I have my kin who is not my blood <em>(add image)</em> and I have them <em>(click)</em></p>

                <p>And they <em>(click)</em> are who I am</p>

                <p style="margin-top: 2rem;">So when I tell you I am Chinese <em>(click)</em>, I don't mean that my cultural food <em>{start playing patriotic chinese music}</em> is the orange chicken that someone who looked like me invented long ago for white Americans. I guess my cultural food is the food my parents ate growing up, in Shanghai, a a state of china, which is comparable in size to most european countries each of which have their own category of cultural food. But i don't know what my parents ate, they were poor, they ate what they could put on. The. table. And chinese culture is too often equated to chinese food anyways.</p>

                <p>When I say I am Chinese, I don't mean that me and my parents' views on family and relationships and ethics and social interactions and sex and love and work are conservative and tiger and strict. ly. outdated and white-washed or white-adoring in the way the imperialists view and told everyone what the East is like.</p>

                <p>My ethnicity is Chinese, but when you politically correctly ask me my ethnicity <em>(click)</em>, where my parents come from <em>(click)</em>, where are you really from <em>(click)</em>, it's such a loaded question that hundreds of ignorant people have asked me in the past and have used to define me<br>
                So today <em>(pause music)</em>, I am defining who I am and redefining that word of what it means to be Chinese to me.</p>

                <p style="font-style: italic;">Slowly,</p>
            
                <p>When I tell you I <em>(click)</em> am Chinese, I'm saying that I am specially connected to these 8 <em>(gesture to the 8)</em> who are,<br>
                and are my only extended family and the many others <em>(gesture)</em> who understand and the millions <em>(show)</em> who experienced this experience and preceded me.</p>
